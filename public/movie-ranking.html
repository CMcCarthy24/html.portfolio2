<h1>Cheyenne's Favorite Childhood Movies</h1>
<hr />
<h3>My Top Three Childhood Movies</h3>
<h4>Spirit Stallion Of The Cimmaron</h4>
<p>I love this movie because you feel every emotion as if you were there with them and the scenery is beautiful.</p>
<h4>The Great Mouse Detective</h4>
<p>This is one of my favorites because I love the Sherlock Holmes esque spin off and it really brings back a lot of nostalgia.</p>
<h4>Lady and the Tramp</h4>
<p>Lady and the Tramp is in my top three becasue it really shows that love can come from all types of backgrounds and you don't have to be within the same zip code to love someone.</p>
